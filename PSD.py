def cal_psd( x, **parms ):
    # Assumptions:
    # 1. 'x' is a 2D array of data measured/sampled at unformly spaced 
    #    instants. The data measured/sampled from a particular channel 
    #    is given along axis0, and channel numbering is given along 
    #    axis1.
    # 2. In all cases, the code returns PSD in the positive direction 
    #    of f-axis, and then doubling the energy in it to account for 
    #    the energy inthe negative direction of f-axis. This is based 
    #    on an assumption of typical symmetries of PSD(-f) = PSD(+f). 
    #    Also note that, in the event that 'x' is complex, x(-f) ~= x(f).
    # 3. Each channel data is divided into blocks of size 'nfft'with a 
    #    'overlap_pcnt' percentage of overlap between them, and the PSD 
    #    over each of the blocks are averaged. Furthermore, to avoid a 
    #    situation where few samples being unused towards the end, the 
    #    overlap between last and last-but-one block can be larger.
    # 4. PSD has units ((Unit of 'x')^**2)/(\Delta Hz). '\Delta Hz' 
    #    is a reflection of the fact that PSD is the density per unit 
    #    width of the frequency bins. In other words, \int {(PSD) (df)} 
    #    is the power of the signal irrespective of frequency parameters 
    #    like 'nfft' or 'fs'
    # 
    # Input parameters:
    #    x: Time-series (2D array)
    #    nfft: Frequency points used to calculate DFT
    #    fs: Sampling frequency
    #    window: Windowing function
    #    overlap_pcnt: Percentage overlap between successive blocks
    #

    #    PSD: Power Spectral Density in ((Units of x) ** 2)/(Delta Hz)
    #    f: Frequency axis
